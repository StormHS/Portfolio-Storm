                <p>Tēnā koe, I am a junior programmer with comprehensive training 
                    in current development tools and 8 years experience in the 
                    not-for-profit sector including 3 years managing remote teams. 
                    I have completed training in JS, Typescript,  React, HTML, CSS, 
                    SQL, Git and more. Alongside these skills, I’m a motivated, 
                    detailed oriented and self-directed person with extensive 
                    experience working in diversity, equity and inclusion. 
                    Outside of coding and social work, I'm a sucker for a beach 
                    day surfing, bouldering with friends and playing football. </p>
